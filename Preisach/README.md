# Preisach_Flipper
This repo contains all the files necessary to run a simulation of a Preisach distribution measurement as described in the accompanying paper [Urbanavičiūtė, I., Cornelissen, T.D., Meng, X. et al. Physical reality of the Preisach model for organic ferroelectrics. Nat Commun 9, 4409 (2018). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-06717-w].
The main file is Flipper_Preisach.m, which contains all input parameters and when run outputs the cumulative Preisach distribution.
