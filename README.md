This repo contains two projects related to the Flipper code presented in [Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of organic ferroelectrics, DOI: 10.1039/C8CP06716C, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2019, 21, 1375-1383]. The first, in the Preisach folder is a deterministic version used to simulate a Preisach distribution. The second project is a comparison between usign a linear and binary search algorithm to run the kMC simulation.
